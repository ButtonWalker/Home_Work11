## The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

## The visualizations show temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4.
